specific antigen ( psa ) screening for prostate cancer has become widespread , the prostate biopsy technique has evolved , and the occurrence of low-risk prostate cancer has been increasing . even low-risk patients may demonstrate disease upgrading or upstaging . we aimed to evaluate the clinical importance of a single microfocal prostate cancer at biopsy in patients subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) screening for prostate cancer has become widespread , the prostate biopsy technique has evolved , and the detection of low-risk prostate cancer has been increasing [ 1 ] . concerns have been expressed that the increased detection of indolent prostate cancer leads to patients receiving unnecessary treatment and dealing with unnecessary side effects [ 2 ] = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) prostate specific antigen diagnostic of pc pc follow-up serum yes yes yes yes = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) is the most used serum biomarker for prostate cancer screening and monitoring . however , its expression is not fully specific for oncological conditions , since it is present at high levels also in benign prostatic hyperplasia or in case of prostatitis . in normal tissues or in benign conditions , high concentrations of active psa are stored in the prostatic collecting ducts [ 144 ] ; in this setting only a small amount of enzyme can leak out , but it forms a complex with its inhibitor , the alpha-1 anti-chymotrypsin ( act ) , generating an inactive psa that can anyway be detected in serum samples by classical procedures . in cancer , this architecture is disrupted , and increased amount of psa is accumulated into the tissue interstitium and is free to leak out in the serum where it is inactivated and detected . the higher level of psa in the interstitium is related to an increased tumor growth rate , and can assume a causal role in prostate cancer progression [ 145 ] = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) doubling time ( psadt ) is an attractive intermediate endpoint for assessing novel therapies in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer ( brpc ) . this study explores whether psadt calculations are influenced by frequency/duration of psa measurements , and whether statistical variability leads investigators to find false significant results = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) as an igf binding protein-3 ( igfbp-3 = 1
specific antigen ( psa ) , stage ( either clinical or pathological ) , and gleason score are firmly established as prognostic indicators in prostate cancer . individually and collectively , they predict for failure after radiation and surgery . the predictive value has been increased with more detailed information such as the addition of the detailed pathological findings of extraprostatic extension ( epe ) , positive margins , seminal vesicle involvement , and lymph node involvement . various combinations of factors have been combined into tables , formulas , neural networks , and nomograms . while they are important tools in trying to predict failure , they are limited by the predictive ability of the factors themselves . for example , from a nomogram , a patient with a gleason 7 ( 3 + 4 ) cancer with extraprostatic extension and positive margins , negative lymph nodes , negative seminal vesicles , and preoperative psa of 8.2 ng/ml is predicted to have a 10-year recurrence rate of 20 % [ 1 ] . telling a patient that he has a 1 out of 5 chance of failing may or may not be reassuring . the absolute precision would be able to tell a patient whether he will fail ( 100 % ) or not ( 0 % ) . the ultimate goal is to try to determine who will fail , not who may fail . the only way to try to approach that goal is with more precise markers than we currently have . one area of major promise in this regard is the greater individual cancer data that can be obtained from molecular markers = 1
