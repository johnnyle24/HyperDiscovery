prostate cancer . individually and collectively , they predict for failure after radiation and surgery . the predictive value has been increased with more detailed information such as the addition of the detailed pathological findings of extraprostatic extension ( epe ) , positive margins , seminal vesicle involvement , and lymph node involvement . various combinations of factors have been combined into tables , formulas , neural networks , and nomograms . while they are important tools in trying to predict failure , they are limited by the predictive ability of the factors themselves . for example , from a nomogram , a patient with a gleason 7 ( 3 + 4 ) cancer with extraprostatic extension and positive margins , negative lymph nodes , negative seminal vesicles , and preoperative psa of 8.2 ng/ml is predicted to have a 10-year recurrence rate of 20 % [ 1 ] . telling a patient that he has a 1 out of 5 chance of failing may or may not be reassuring . the absolute precision would be able to tell a patient whether he will fail ( 100 % ) or not ( 0 % ) . the ultimate goal is to try to determine who will fail , not who may fail . the only way to try to approach that goal is with more precise markers than we currently have . one area of major promise in this regard is the greater individual cancer data that can be obtained from molecular markers": 1, "biomarkers , prostate":
