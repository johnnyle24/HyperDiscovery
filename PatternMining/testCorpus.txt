Previous studies in endodontics have used micro-CT for evaluation of root canal anatomy . The relation between the external and internal macro-morphology , shape of the root complex and the number of canals has been investigated and an agreement between external root macrostructures
The operators were dental students who had undergone theoretical and practical instructions and exercises in endodontics . Initially in the study they prepared all root canals .
Four questions assessed the perception and 20 questions assessed the knowledge , which were based on the four domains viz . : General , Endodontics , Orthodontics , and Prosthodontics .
Part B was further divided into four domains : General ( 2 questions ) , Endodontics ( 3 questions ) , Orthodontics ( 3 questions ) , and Prosthodontics ( 12 questions )
This might require a contribution from the disciplines of endodontics , periodontics , orthodontics and prosthodontics for predictable results

The use of NIV in ARF of different etiologies in immunocompromised patients ( patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for solid organ or bone marrow transplant110,111 ) is well supported in terms of significant reduction of EI and in-hospital mortality rates . The benefits of NIV compared with other ventilatory approaches in patients who have hematological malignancies is controversial , and further research is needed to clarify the role of NIV as respiratory support in ARF in hematologic patients.112–116
